# Best Model Selection
#### Deep Learning Enthusiast, It for you

Hi Deep learning enthusiast, You must be work with model.In transfer learning method everyone try make own model using pretrain model (EfficientB7, VGG-19, inceptionv3, resnet, etc)
But which model may be best for you?
Criteria for selecting models In general, there are two competing criteria while doing any machine learning task in the industry:

1.Accuracy of the model: Higher Better

2.Speed of Model Training and Predictions: Faster Better
